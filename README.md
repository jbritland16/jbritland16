## About Me

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. My name is Julia Britland and I am an aspiring developer. These repositories contain projects I created 
as a part of the Albany Beck Technology Pioneers Program. In this program, I received training and hands-on experience in the skills in highest 
demand from tech companies, including instruction on best practices used within the industry.

Skills developed in this program include:

- Java with Spring (Object-Oriented Programming, Spring Boot, Maven, multi-tiered architecture)
- Databases (MySQL, JDBC API, Spring Data JPA)
- Web development (RESTful APIs, microservice architecture, Spring MVC, Java Server Pages and Servlets)
- Testing (JUnit, Test-Driven Development, mock libraries)
- Software development lifecycle (version control with Git, Jenkins CI/CD pipeline)
- Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Workflow management (Agile methodologies, Jira, Confluence)

In addition, I previously learned a variety of skills in a university computer science course and a software engineering bootcamp given by 
HyperionDev and co-certified by the University of Manchester, including:

- C++
- SQLite for Python
- Natural Language Processing with spaCy
- Web development with Django
- Front-end development with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

I am continually looking to learn new skills and am eager to get my start as a software developer.

## Projects

Currently, I have two public repositories where you can view my work: Classroom Exercises and OrderBook. The OrderBook project is a fully functional 
web-based app that can be deployed to a TomCat server, whereas the projects in Classroom Exercises focus more on specific concepts we learned during the training program. Here is an overview of each project in my portfolio.

### Classroom Exercises repository

#### Banking Application 

This Java project is a basic banking application that allows users to create bank accounts, carry out transactions, and view their 
account information. The tech stack for this project includes Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and JDBC API. Currently, it is only for use 
with a data endpoint like Postman, but I'm working on refactoring the project to use Spring Security for authentication and learning 
JavaScript so that I can create responsive front-end views.

#### Data Assessment

This project is a database that stores information for a real estate company; rather than focusing on an end-to-end solution, it is focused 
on database design using MySQL. The repository contains Entity-Relationship Diagrams for my database and the queries to build and populate 
the database.

#### Python Assessment

This project is a console-based app that analyzes data from an external source on fuel efficiency in different models and years of cars. 
The app is written in Python and uses NumPy and Pandas for data management and transformation, and Matplotlib for visualization.

### OrderBook

This project was the culminating work in the Pioneers Program. As the leader of a team of three, I used Agile methodologies to 
maximize our productivity in developing this app. The program is a stock trading app that allows users to browse stocks, create an 
account, enter orders, and view history. It automatically matches orders to execute trades. My personal contribution was largely within 
the trading engine responsible for storing and accessing data on orders, matching orders, and executing trades. I also used RESTful controllers, 
a Eureka server, and a Feign client to enable communications between our microservices. Additionally, while assisting my team in their work, 
I performed some work with Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, HTML, and Spring Security. The repository contains a link to a video demonstration of our 
functioning app.

## Thanks for visiting!

I will update my profile as I continue to learn new skills, improve these apps, and complete new projects. I hope you enjoy viewing my work!
